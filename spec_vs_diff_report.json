  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of the requested requirements. All 10 REQs have corresponding implementations. However, a few specific acceptance criteria have gaps: the navigation bar is missing 'About Us' as a top-level menu item, Form 15G/15H links are absent from the Forms dropdown, and the required images (Ashoka emblem, header banner, flag strip) are not referenced in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Navigation bar must include 'About Us' as a top-level dropdown item matching incometax.gov.in structure",
      "reason": "The NAV_ITEMS array in PortalLayout.tsx does not include an 'About Us' menu item. The spec explicitly requires it alongside Home, e-Filing, Tax Services, Forms, Downloads, Help & FAQ.",

      "requirement": "Forms dropdown must include ITR-1 through ITR-7 and Form 15G/15H links as individual dropdown items",
      "reason": "The Forms dropdown in NAV_ITEMS only contains 'ITR Forms' (internal link) and 'All Forms & Downloads' (external). Individual ITR form links and Form 15G/15H entries are not present as dropdown items.",
